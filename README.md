Current feature selection methods only return a list of predictive features. However, features often don't act alone, but with each other. Take XOR as a simple example, feature 1 *literally* provides
no information without also knowing the value of feature 2 and vice versa. This work aims to solve the problem of **Composite Feature Selection**, where we find the groups of features that act together.

*Our model CompFS. We use an ensemble of group selection models to discover
composite features and an aggregate predictor to combine these features when issuing predictions.*


## Abstract 

In many real world problems, features do not act alone but in combination with each other. 
For example, in genomics, diseases might not be caused by any single mutation but require the presence of multiple mutations. 
Prior work on feature selection either seeks to identify individual features or can only determine relevant groups from a predefined set. 
We investigate the problem of discovering groups of predictive features without predefined grouping. 
To do so, we define predictive groups in terms of linear and non-linear interactions between features. 
We introduce a novel deep learning architecture that uses an ensemble of feature selection models to find predictive groups, without requiring candidate groups to be provided.
The selected groups are sparse and exhibit minimum overlap.
Furthermore, we propose a new metric to measure similarity between discovered groups and the ground truth.
We demonstrate the utility of our model on multiple synthetic tasks and semi-synthetic chemistry datasets, where the ground truth structure is known, as well as an image dataset and a real-world cancer dataset.

*Our new metric for determining similarity between sets of discovered group features. Our metric is based on a normalized Jaccard similarity between the ground truth and the discovered groups.*


## Getting Started

### Installing Packages
We used `python 3.7` for this project. To setup the virtual environment and necessary packages, please run the following commands:
```bash
$ conda create -n compfs python=3.7
$ conda activate compfs
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
`PyTorch 1.4.0` is also required, which can be installed from the [official website](https://pytorch.org/).

### Datasets
The datasets have not been included here to save space. Download each dataset and place in the following folders:
- Chemisty Data: [Link](https://github.com/google-research/graph-attribution/raw/main/data/all_16_logics_train_and_test.zip) store data in *datasets/chem_data/* (copy and paste from the 'all_16_logics_train_and_test' folder)
- Metabric Data: [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/raghadalharbi/breast-cancer-gene-expression-profiles-metabric) store data in $datasets/metabric/data*

### Running the Experiments
